Y Scouts never made me feel like I was part of a transaction; I felt like I was working with a friend and an ally throughout the entire process, who kept my best interests in mind at all times. I felt like my executive recruiter truly took the time to get to know me, my motivations and what type of opportunity would help me grow and succeed. Y Scouts helped me move into an incredible new role, and I am thankful everyday that Y Scouts helped connect me to an organization and position that align perfectly with my skills and personal passions. I would absolutely recommend working with Y Scouts to any organization with a true commitment to finding the right leaders.[/ut_single_quote][/ut_one_half]

In the early stage of my search for a new career, I spoke with several recruiting firms, and was quickly drawn to the <a href="http://yscouts.com">Y Scouts approach</a>. They took the time to figure out my wants and needs beyond the mechanics of a job. Personality fit, culture, advancement potential, and work life balance were all discussed before I ever saw a job description. 

Their approach told me that they genuinely wanted to find the best fit for both the candidate and the employer. Career transitions are challenging for even the most senior executive. Y Scouts recognized this challenge and spent time checking on how the “person” was doing, not just the “candidate”. 

I give my highest of recommendations to Y Scouts.
