<!-- Why Purpose -->
<div class="ys-pageintro no-header"><p><span>The old executive recruiting model is broken and </span>out of touch with where business is going. Modern day ambitious and proven leaders don't want their heads to be hunted and recycled within an industry. They seek ways to express their life in meaningful work and true purpose, the two in deep alignment. Executive search is really exchanging bodies from competitor to competitor without concern for company's impact over the long term. </p></div>

<p>The word executive itself conjures up thoughts of corner office politics and high comp. In fact, what the world needs is more leaders, not execs. Today's leading brands are the ones that honor purpose and profit, over just profit alone. Millennials will soon make up half the leaders inside organizations.</p>
